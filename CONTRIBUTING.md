# Contributing

Contributions to this project are always welcome. We strive to make contributions simple and easy to understand for everyone. When thinking about contributing to this project your suggestions or ideas should be ones that this project as a whole would benefit from. Never should proposed changes / additions be with one Discord server / bot application in mind. 

When contributing, we do ask that you follow some simple guidelines: 

### 1. Create an Issue
Before anything, create or review the open issues. This will be where you or others post about additions, corrections, and enhanacements. By doing so we can help mitigate the risk of multiple contributors working on the same enhancements. 

Please fill out your issue as such

| Field | Description | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------| 
| Title | Enhancement / correction you propose being added. | true | 
| Difficulty | Added for when you are not contributing this code yourself. Helps developers who want to contribute to know whether this may be something that they can take on based on their currently level of knowlege | false
| Description | A detailed explanation of what you are proposing, how you or others may go about implementing this suggestion | true |
| Additional Info | Any other information you think is important | false | 
| Needed Modules | If a specific module that isnt included in Node, or discord.js, put here. preferrably with a link to the module on NPM | true |

**NOTE** Leave out the difficulty field if you intend to add this contribution yourself. Other developers will know that by the exclusion of the 
difficulty field that you are implementing this yourself. 

### 2. Fork the Repository
Changes are never to be made to the main branch. Make sure you fork the repository and make your changes to the fork. Any changes should be formatted
using the prettier extension in Visual Studio Code or other similar formatting tools. Indentation level (2 spaces = 1 tab).

### 3. Create a Pull Request
Once you have made your changes and are happy with it, create pull request linking to your created issue. This way your issue is closed on merge.
Once your pull request has been submitted, a verified collaborator will review the changes and will either merge or request revisions.
